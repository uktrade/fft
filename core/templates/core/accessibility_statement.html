    <p class="govuk-body">The Financial Forecasting Tool allows users to create and view departmental

        The tool is maintained by the Live Services Team in DDaT. The Finance department is responsible
        for the content of the tool. This page explains how the Live Services Team works to ensure the
        Financial Forecasting Tool is accessible.

    <p class="govuk-body">The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the
        Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018
        (the ‘accessibility regulations’).</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">The content that is not accessible is outlined below with details of:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li class="govuk-body">where it fails the success criteria</li>
        <li class="govuk-body">planned dates for when issues will be fixed</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">Some tables in content do not have table row headers when needed.
        This fails WCAG 2.1A 1.3.1 success criterion (Info and Relationships).
        This is a limitation of the publishing tool which we plan to fix by October 2020.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Focused links and buttons sometimes do not have enough contrast.
        This fails WCAG 1.4.11 AA (Non-text Contrast). We plan to fix this by October 2020.

        <li class="govuk-body">The homepage</li>
        <li class="govuk-body">‘Chart of Account’ section</li>

    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The Live Services team works hard to ensure that this tool
        and the codebase it uses is accessible.
    </p>

        assistive technologies - including screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools.
